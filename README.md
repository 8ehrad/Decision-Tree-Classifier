# Decision-Tree-Classifier
Decision trees are one of the most successful classifiers in machine learning. They are known for their
interpretability, relatively fast speed and simplicity. The aim of this project is to build a decision
tree from scratch and compare it with the existing model implemented in Sklearn library, both in terms
of machine learning aspects and computational aspects. For this aim, three different datasets with
significantly different sizes are used to test both models. In addition to this, different sets of
hyperparameters are employed to test the modelsâ€™ performance under different settings. To compare the
results obtained by the two models, different statistical techniques are applied. Regression models can
estimate the relation between the training time of models and given variables (e.g. sample size). Also,
some graphs are shown to see how the f1-score as a measure of goodness changes with hyperparameters.
Finally, t-test is applied to see if there is a significant difference between the results of the two models.
